# GitHub pull requests report (GPRR)

This script creates PR report, that can help with understanding situation with PRs in a high level - how many PRs are in open state, how many PRs are assigned to particular developer, etc.

It is quite usefull report for scrum masters, team leads and team members, who want to see high level picture. 

Why HTML report: all is simple. HTML report is interactive, it is easier to show multilayer information. Plus, usually online scrum's stand ups are performed with screen sharing - usually it is browser with Jira, VersionOne or other tools. I believe it is logical to create report as html page that can be opened in new tab
